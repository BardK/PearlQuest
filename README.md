## Hello Weary Traveller, come and rest, and listen to the story of adventure!

Pearl Quest is a game made by our group as a project for our coding course. It is written in python using the pygame extension.

**Choose between 3 unique classes and embark on a journey of magic and ghost slaying!**

This project was really fun to develop, whether it was creating sprites, creating fun gameplay mechanics or spending hours debugging :')
