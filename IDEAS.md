 Gameplay:
  At the start of the game, the player chooses what class they want to play; 3 classes? (swordsman, mage, guy with a gun)
  Levels, zelda rip off
  
Story: you come across an evil fella in the forest during your stroll in the forbidden forest (as one does) (first level), they are experimenting with (dark magic?), you defeat them but they escape narrowly with their life. The people that they kidnapped ask you to stop evil guy from taking over the world with (dark magic? or like mind control or something) and also they bribe you with a large sum of money. They say that to defeat evil man you need to aquire the 3 "pearls of power" to seal away the bad guy's dark pearl. so you go to 3 different places to get the pearls, then go beat up the bad guy. after defeating him, you destroy the pearl of darkness and save the world the end!

5 levels:forbidden forest(really just a regular looking forest) ,  sandblasted temple (sandy level), grotto ruins (sea themed level),  sky island castle (sky castle), final tower (dark, bricky themed level)
levels filled with bad guys working for evil man (they are guarding the pearls of power) 
each level will have a boss, for the 3 themed levels, the final boss is one of evil mans top henchmen: 
  level 1 - evil man base form
  level 2 - Sandy (throws sand at you idfk)
  level 3 - Ahab (makes waves of water)
  level 4 - Palidin (really big sword guy)
  level 5 - evil guy ultimate powered up form
  
  
  name ideas for evil guy (very edgy): Typhon, Abbadon, Asura, darkness mc evilface, Killian, Lazarus
