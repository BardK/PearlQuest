# NE111-Game
First steps: 
To-do-list: Sprites
  GUI
  problems
  animations
 
 Gameplay:
  At the start of the game, the player chooses what class they want to play; 3 classes? (swordsman, mage, guy with a gun)
  Turn Based, like pokemon.
  
  Alternate idea: how about you just spam a button and shoot things at the bad guy (who is standing across from you) and you beat them
  
  
  Each class has a special attack they use when you get the question right, a normal attack when you get it wrong
    (you are guarenteed to attack every turn)
 Lore: (basically the story) 

  Notes for anthony:
  PLayer picks character, in if loops corresponding to buttons
  creates a player class with that selection as an input, and has corresponding outputs
